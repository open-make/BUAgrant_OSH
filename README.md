# We got the grant !

We will start to work on this project in september 2021. Stay tuned: more information is coming!


# BUA call open science and research quality

We have prepared a grant application for this call. After working in this repository, and hackmd.io, we realised the text had to be copy-pasted into their form, and we therefore continued to work on it via a googledoc document. The pdf coming out of the application procedures is visible here (Jochem R Berlin University Alliance Forschungsqualitt und Open Science.pdf), some administrative issues will still be modified.

Anyone is welcome to contact us via issues here. We will get a better organised contribution pathway if we get the grant :)


## Older presentation




We are planning to build a prototype architecture for the peer review and publication of hardware, as well as producing guidance for open FAIR hardware developement. It aims at (1) defining workflows and documentation needs for the production of FAIR hardware and (2) build a prototype to make these FAIR hardware open and citable. 
> FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable

We had first defined our objectives and work packages in [this early document](discussion_doc.md). We also worked on the application [here](grantapplication.Rmd) (docx file was created via the Rbookdown package, and pasted in a google document for further work).
We also worked on these documents using hackmd:
