# Abstract 
<!--- of project proposal (Maximum 2000 characters including spaces) --->

Open access publishing, open data and free and open source software have become important pillars of responsible research and innovation (RRI), maximising the integrity and impact of research outputs. Presently, a new school of thought is emerging which aims to establish an open source hardware (OH) strategy for academia. OH communities are extending the principles of free and open source from software development into physical products. ~~Open hardware describes tangible products “for which a free right of any use belongs to the general public and whose documentation is completely available and freely accessible on the Internet” (DIN SPEC 3105-1:2020 - Open Source Hardware).~~ By enabling hardware reuse and quality control, the OH strategy is filling an important gap in the promotion of FAIR data principles by national funding agencies and the European Commission (seeking to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). 

This project will contribute to this mission through new methods, tools, guidance, standards and awareness building to evaluate and preserve the replicability of hardware in academia. We will pool expertise in hardware evaluation at the TUB, academic hardware making at the FUB and scholarly communication and data management at the HUB. Created solutions will be prototyped and verified within ongoing hardware projects of the partners in the fields of automation, physical metrology and virtual reality applications. Our cross-disciplinary approach is oriented towards creating a new recognition system for researchers building open, FAIR hardware and thus creating the opportunity for new carrier paths. With this practice-oriented project, the Berlin University Alliance will create a centre of competence in Berlin for the development of novel standards and tools for hardware documentation and publication. Moreover, open, FAIR hardware presents a new alternative to traditional intellectual property rights (IPR) practices, reflecting the wider role of academic research in society.

>IMPORTANCE OF HARDWARE IN ACADEMIA: TIM

Although hardware creation (and especicially open source hardware) has been a large part of the research process in many different disciplines, hardware making is still not recognized in academia. While we see pioneering approach to publish data and software related to a reseach article (see https://blog.datadryad.org/2021/02/08/doing-it-right-a-better-approach-for-software-amp-data/), there is no publication system for hardware, and no direct mention of hardware in the DFG kodex `r citep("10.5281/zenodo.3923602")`. Even in the CREDIT initiative that want to create incentives for non-canonical contribution in research `r citep("10.1080/08989621.2020.1779591 ")`, hardware making has been left out.
Accordingly, there is no incentive and few tools for researchers to provide documentation for their hardware design.

Research data and software are in contrast published using specific licenses, specific platforms (Dryad and zenodo for example), specific evaluation mechanisms (data curation and software review), and the community is recommending the citation of these instances instead of the research paper (`r citet("10.12688/f1000research.26932.2")`, see WP2b for more details).
As a consequence, the publication of datasets and software start to be recognised as an important research outputs (see guideline 13 of the DFG kodex `r citet("10.5281/zenodo.3923602")`).


The hardware makers communities are organising themselves, but there is still few representation of these communities in larger organisation devoted to scholarly communication (FORCE11) or data management (RDA: Research Data Alliance). In particular, there are different initiatives aiming at creating an evaluation workflow for hardware.

>HARDWARE EVALUATION INTRO: ROBERT


### Project objectives

We want to create a prototype for a hardware publication system, in order to build the foundation for a recognition of hardware making skills in academia. It will include a certification system specific for FAIR and open hardware. We will work with open indexing system (datacite) to adapt publication pathways used for data and software. This system will explore new incentives (independent of journals) for the production of better hardware documentation in academia, irrespective of the research domain. 

In addition, we want to provide researchers with tools to guide their work along the whole process of open and FAIR hardware design. In particular, we will write a guide will be provided as an open book, using a technology similar to the turing way book `r citep("10.5281/zenodo.3233853")`.
In order to extract best practices in hardware collaborative creation, we will analyse  current workflows in use, their successes and shortcomings. In addition,
we will dissect the  certification process of some chosen hardware pieces in neuroscience, robotics and medicine. 
This open project will be performed in close collaboration with FORCE11, `datacite,` the open source hardware association, and the Gathering for Open Science Hardware communities.







### Open science and quality control

~~While being mostly developed for the quality control topic of this call, this project also covers some aspects of the open science line.~~

- line 1:
    - quality control
    - interdisciplinary
    - evaluation tool
    - new indicators
    
- line 2 open science: 
    - analysis of current practices in hardware creation
    - open practices in the dissemination of hardware documentation (license, publication)  
    - prototyping tools to get independent from publishers (open infrastructure)

The project Open!Make fully addresses Line 1: Research Quality and  specific aspects of Line 2: Open Science as part of implementation and through actions for impact maximisation.

#### Open!Make’s responses to Line 1: Research Quality

**Area 1: Research quality in different disciplines**: Hardware development requires for it to be continuously documented, in order for the resulting technology to serve as an exploitable result. Traditionally, publicly funded research projects tend to seek IP protection through patents, design and trademark application. While this is common practice, RRI involves holding research to high ethical standards including the reproducibility of research results.  
On the other hand, research often depends on self-made hardware solutions that are developped during the scientific project, but are not disseminated outside of single project. One single researcher is often responsible for building, testing and using these solutions, and there is no organised quality control in most labs.  
This impediment of information sharing and quality control leads to duplicated work, sometimes innaccuracies in research results, and difficulties in results comparisons which even happens at a single lab level. Because researchers are lacking guidance on making hardware documentation, the cost for sharing and controlling hardware is too high for them, especially as there is no visible benefit, and they rapidely get stuck in their will of sharing.  
Open!Make will enable researchers and joint research projects to easily evaluate and publish hardware according to open hardware and FAIR data principles. This provides an alternative to IP and a sustainable path that ensures unhindered reuse of products by any actor interested in making use of and benefiting from these resources. Moreover, verifying developed solutions within ongoing hardware projects of the partners in the fields of automation, medical device, physical metrology and virtual reality applications will ensure that different disciplines are taken into account. These include biology, neurology, medecine and physics amongst many others.


**Area 2: Evaluation and assessment procedures**: 
Defining quality criteria in hardware development for research requires to consider issues such as project goals, stakeholder needs, technical,  regional and sectoral conditions (environmental, socioeconomic, geographical, cultural) and to then translate them into technical requirements. From there technology is prototyped, demonstrated, optimized and qualified against these requirements. Proprietary logic leads for the validation of requirements' fulfillment to happen within project boundaries. Hardware development according to OH and FAIR data principles however presents additional requirements (e.g. transparency, accessibility, replicability, etc.) and their independent evaluation. In response to this, Open!Make aims to create new processes and infrastructure for the evaluation of hardware replicability and publication of product- and process-related documentation. While the former develops qualitative methodology to assess the conformity of hardware with OH and FAIR principles, the latter allows to attribute individual contributors of research outputs from hardware making. Since such research outputs are largely unrecognized in academia, this will lead to new quantitative indicators beyond the visibility of published research articles.

#### Open!Make’s responses to Line 2: Open Science 
> this might be too long
> 
> We could move the input for area 1 to the work programm and shorten it here.

**Area 1: Funding of open science practices**: 
We will promote new evaluation criteria for awarding and allocation of research funds by universities and funding agencies beyond traditional indicators (no. of PhDs, journal papers, etc.). Moreover, we will engage in the following collaborative actions that enable researchers and joint research projects to apply for research funding to fulfil additional requirements by OH and FAIR data principles:
- Supporting the “Open Hardware Maker Curriculum” by creating guidelines on the documentation, evaluation and publishing of open, FAIR hardware in the form of new modules
- Supporting ongoing standardisation initiatives, e.g. the extension of the DIN SPEC 3105:2020 - Open Source Hardware for science.

Peer to peer practices and evaluation approaches of open, FAIR hardware can enable universities to remain independent from publishers. Therefore, another important output will be a report on the basic infrastructure requirements to enable documentation, evaluation and publishing of open, FAIR hardware.

**Area 2: Analysis of disciplinary framework conditions for open science**:
In Open!Make, we will map national and international standards for technical documentation and open data sharing and create/promote international consortium dedicated to build a better framework (FROCE11). 

**Area 3: Studies on science policy**:
As part of the needs analysis for Open!Make solutions, we will rely on qualitative data acquisition of current practices in hardware creation considering in particular the partners’ institutions.  
In Open!Make, we will engae in pro-active cooperation with other relevant projects on the harmonising of practices in open, FAIR hardware from academia (licensing, evaluation, publication, etc.); and with relevant actors (university libraries, university administrations, publishers and funding agencies) and initiatives (e.g. German Reproducibility Network) on the wider establishment of conformity assessment and indicators of open, FAIR hardware.

#### General call requirements
With this practice-oriented project, the Berlin University Alliance will create a centre of competence in Berlin for the development of novel standards and tools for hardware documentation and publication. Open!Make is moreover keen to cooperate with BUA Objective 5: Sharing Resources and the BUA Cross Cutting Themes on issues such as diversity, gender, teaching, and internationalization.


## Einordnung des Vorhabens in den aktuellen internationalen Forschungsstand (maximal eine Seite bzw. 3,500 Zeichen inkl. Leerzeichen)


OSH is a realtively new topic, not yet covered by force11.
- relation to DFG kodex (hardware = data)

In this project, we will bring open data and open source software workflows into hardware, in collaboration with the GOSH.

- relation to GOSH, and OSHA
- relation to RDA, Force11, NFDI-neuro

## Detailliertes Arbeitsprogramm einschließlich der geplanten Meilensteine, Ausführungen zum me- thodischen Vorgehen (einschließlich einer diesbezüglichen Risikoabschätzung), zur theoretischen Rahmung des Vorhabens sowie gegebenenfalls zum Feldzugang (maximal drei Seiten bzw. 11,000 Zeichen inkl. Leerzeichen)

### WP1: Surveying hardware practices in academia

In this first work package, we will grow a hardware maker community in the BUA, analyse specific use cases, and build a larger survey of the different practices and needs of the community. This will help us refine the second WP and feed the third WP with pragmatical data on best practices and shortcomings in hardware design and sharing.

We will find and contact researchers (focusing on Berlin based researchers) who are active in hardware development and conduct qualitative one on one interviews. We will also use these interviews to add interesting use case to the existing list for further analysis (see below) and make initial contact to build a community of academic hardware makers.

We will also actively seek for additional collaborators and international networks during this first phase of the project. We will coordinate our work with the gathering of open source hardware to create a FORCE11 interest group (or altenatively a RDA working group).

Importantly, we will analyse several hardware piece in details, how they were designed, shared and disseminated. While we will complete this list during the work, we already have 3 use cases:

- The Airtrack system `r citep("10.1152/jn.00088.2016")` has been developped in 2016 in the Larkum lab and was re-built in a lab in the USA in 2018. We will analyse this relatively long process.
- robofish `r citep(" 10.1098/rsbl.2020.0436")`
- open imaging

Expected outputs:
- FORCE11 interest group
- Blog post(s) on the FORCE website
- dataset of interview analysis
- dataset of use case analysis

### WP2 Hardware publication system

#### a) Peer review system for hardware publication

#### b) Publication system

>In addition, hese pathways are coming with specialised quality insurance mechansims. Data curation is following FAIR principles, originally developped by the FORCE11 coomunity `r citep("10.1038/sdata.2016.18")`, and software review are run on git platforms, for example in the journal of Open Source Software (JOSS, ISSN 2475-9066), following community standards.

In addition to quality control, a publication system should provide recognition to the authors (or contributors) who worked on the project, a long term archive of the research results, a registration of the work (allowing people to find it), and awareness. 

Registration and awareness depends on the use of a metadata model that is used in the targetted community. We want to expand the metadata model used for most data and software publication, i.e. the datacite model and/or [the schema.org model](https://schema.org/). This would allow for specific search and hardware discovery tools, that are in developement for datasets (see https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/discovery/).

## Beschreibung der geplanten Maßnahmen zum Forschungsdatenmanagement und zur Publikations- strategie. Publikationen und Forschungsdaten sind kostenfrei zugänglich zu machen. (maximal eine Seite bzw. 3,500 Zeichen inkl. Leerzeichen)

This project will be run using an open research methodology, where data, results, discussion and ideas will be shared in an open repository on GIN (gin.g-node.org/), using a standard research folder organsation `r citep("10.25815/WCY6-M233")`. raw (or anonimised) datasets will be made available with a CC0 license upon collection, or as soon as legally possible. Data will be curated, and its analysis will be preformed using reproducible reports, in order to facilitate re-use. Upon publication, the whole repository will be archived and published via the GIN platform.

Hardware will be published following the workflow developed in this project, under an open source license for hardware.

Intermediary reports will be published on blog platforms specialised in scholarly communication or hardware makers (depending on the topic of the report). Manuscript will be uploaded in a preprint server before submission to a journal. Following plan S, only gold and diamond open access journal (offering CC-BY license and copyright retention by the authors, and being in the DOAJ index), will be considered as host for our outputs, the latter being prefered.
