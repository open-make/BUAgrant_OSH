In this blog post, I would like to discuss the role open badges could gain in scholarly communication, taking the example of the publication of hardware piece.<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>There are currently no system for hardware publication in academia. Few makers (creators of hardware) have put the documentation of their hardware on Github or similar platform, in order to facilitate the reuse of their work. However, there is no recognition for them to do this work, let it be inside or outside of academia. There are some certification process in beta phase, but these are still very premature and did not plan to give any recognition outside of the certification platform itself, yet. <br>
</p>

<p>Open badges is a decentralised certification system, badges can be given both to persons (mostly to an email address actually) and to url. This latter functionality is quite interesting as we will see. Indeed, hardware documentation could be "published" the same way software are published nowadays, that is an archive of the documents is made, and a persistent identifier is given (mostly a doi). Therefore, hardware communities could issue badges to the hardware persistent identifier, for example certifying that the documentation allow the reproduction or tuning of the published hardware. The certification could then be automatically forwarded to the authors of the hardware (whose information is included in the metadata created during publication) and these makers could then show a recognition of the quality of their work inside their profile of choice. <br>
The fact that orcid is working on the implementation of open badges could mean a way to show off their maker's skill in their academic profile.<br>
<br>
If this work, it may open the route for the certification of good scientific practices by giving other open badges to traditional publication and their authors, like the presence of FAIR data, software, hardware, reagents and so on; building a decentralised recognition of open research practices in academia.<br>

What technology/platform to use ?<br>
<br>
I&nbsp;have&nbsp;not&nbsp;much&nbsp;time&nbsp;to&nbsp;look&nbsp;into&nbsp;details,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;would&nbsp;tend&nbsp;to&nbsp;look&nbsp;at&nbsp;badgr&nbsp;first.&nbsp;Indeed&nbsp;they&nbsp;already&nbsp;implemented open badges 2.1&nbsp;and&nbsp;seem&nbsp;to&nbsp;be at&nbsp;the&nbsp;tip&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;technology.&nbsp;I&nbsp;also&nbsp;met/zoom&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;while&nbsp;discussing&nbsp;an implementation&nbsp;of&nbsp;open&nbsp;badges&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;OSMOOC&nbsp;and&nbsp;he&nbsp;seemed&nbsp;very&nbsp;open to&nbsp;discussions.<br>
<br>
I would still try to look into ways to design the badge figure outside of badgr, and (since it is an open hardware related project) ways to create badges that can also be 3d printed. ;)<br>
